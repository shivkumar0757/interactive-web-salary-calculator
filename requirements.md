# Task 2: Interactive Web Page

## Overview
You have been assigned to create an interactive data visualization based on the developers salary data from JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey 2024. Use the following Figma design (password AirRPP_homework2025) and this reference page to implement this visualization with working filters. Use calculatorData.json as data for visualization. You can use any frontend framework for this task. The data can be either stored as a static file, or served via your own API (or via any other method). Include README on how to set up the project and run the application.

- **Figma Design**: Password: AirRPP_homework2025
- **Data Source**: calculatorData.json

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Interactive Data Visualization**: Create salary data visualization similar to the JetBrains reference page
2. **Working Filters**: Implement filters for:
   - Programming language
   - Country/Location  
   - Experience level
   - Other relevant criteria from the data
3. **Data Display**: Show salary ranges and distributions based on selected filters

### Technical Requirements
- Use any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Data can be stored as static file or served via API
- Responsive design matching Figma specifications
- Interactive charts/graphs for data visualization

### Implementation Steps
1. Analyze the data structure in calculatorData.json
2. Research Figma design and reference page functionality
3. Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)
4. Create Low Level Design (LLD) for frontend
5. Set up development environment and tech stack
6. Implement the interactive visualization
7. Create comprehensive README with setup instructions

### Deliverables
- Working interactive web application
- Filters that dynamically update visualizations
- Responsive UI matching design specifications
- Complete documentation for setup and usage

## Goals
- Understand the problem and requirements thoroughly
- Research design patterns from Figma and reference page
- Build a production-ready interactive salary calculator
- Provide clear documentation for future maintenance
